Implementation of the following algorithms that check whether a point belongs to a polygon:
1. Sumz of area
2. Orientation method
3. Grid method
The algorithms are implemented in the C++ programming language and in the Wolfram Mathematica computer algebra system. In both cases, time measurements were added to evaluate the speed of each algorithm.
The text files store the data of the points (10, 100, etc. - their number. DataGrid - data for grid method).
You can see a detailed description of the algorithms in the attached article.
